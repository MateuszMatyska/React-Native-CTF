# React Native CTF
This is my very first React Native CTF app. But you don't need to find any flags but all vulnerabilities. 

## List of vulnerabilities 
* Non obfuscated code
* Hardcoded credentials
* No Root Detection
* Unsecure storage
* Unsecure webview
* DeepLink with action
* ONLY FOR ANDROID - Bridge Code Bypass.

## Links with knowledge
* [OWASP MSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) 
* [Netguru Security Checklist](https://github.com/netguru/mobile-security-checklist/releases/tag/1.0)
