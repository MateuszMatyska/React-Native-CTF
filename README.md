# React Native CTF
This is my very first React Native CTF app. But you don't need to find any flags but all vulnerabilities. 

## List of vulnerabilities 
* Non obfuscated code
* Hardcoded credentials
* No Root Detection
* Unsecure storage
* Unsecure webview
* DeepLink with action
* ONLY FOR ANDROID - Bridge Code Bypass.
